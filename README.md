## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a little bit of css and flexbox in practice, for example when you add an image and youi want the image even if he is larger that your div you can still accomodate it insidde the div.


```css
.qr-code-image {
    width: 288px;
    height: 288px;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 24px;
}
```

### Continued development

I am new to css, so i will improve, principally in responsiveness and trying to build also complex layout.
